## Statement Blocks and Variable Scope

### Initialization Statements

- The additional *initialization statement* is executed prior to evaluating the
*condition* expression.

```cpp
if (initialization; condition) {
    // The code goes here
}

switch (initialization; condition) {
    // The code goes here
}
```
